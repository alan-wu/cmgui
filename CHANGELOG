This software is the cmgui part of CMISS.
It is released under the Mozilla Public License v1.1

Further information, help pages, a tracker and a wiki is available at 
http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/

v2.2
Removed computed variables by default.  To put it back in change USE_COMPUTED_VARIABLES to true in the makefile or by specifying it on the make command line.
Added new texture wrap modes edge_clamp_wrap, border_clamp_wrap and
mirrored_repeat_wrap from recent versions of OpenGL.
Fixed problems with methods not being fully set correctly for some computed fields.
Changes to support streamlines in tetrahedral meshes.
Changes to support isosurface generation in tetrahedral meshes.
Fixed to grid point evaluation.
Allowing streamlines to be seeded from the nodes in a region.
v2.1.1
Large speed improvements for "gfx select nodes" and "gfx select elements".
Get regions to cache get_next_element_id so that it can be kept over multiple commands.
Image resampling improvements.
Started 'gfx export cm'
Reenabled automatic monochrome storage of images.
Added a weighting field to "gfx create snake".
Added a few more logical operators for less_than, greater_than and equal_to in computed fields. 
v2.1
Fix comfile script: cmgui-2.1/fixcom.pl
Added support for fitting multiple fields with "gfx create snake"
Began "gfx export cm" to write files for the old cm.
Added gfx convert elements (and changed the old gfx convert to be gfx convert graphics) which converts one form of elements to another. The only conversion I have implemented so far is the conversion of any 2D element surfaces to true toplevel 2D bicubic hermite elements. The cross-derivatives are not correct and need to think about how to fix this.
v2.0.2
Fixed gfx unselect data.
Fixed contour bands on iso_surfaces.
Fixed code for allocation of large arrays to use long ints where necessary.
Added code so that node changes propogate through a nodal_lookup computed field to a computed_field change.
Fixed a couple of bugs in cmgui with the scene editor and an iso_values list.
Many minor fixes of leaks or use of uninitialised values as detected by the new valgrind testing.
v2.0.1
Added glyph functionality to create graph axes
Added first pass at iso_surface_decimation.
Added a new coordinate system where objects are displayed relative to screen coordinates.
v2.0.0
First open source release.  License updated to Mozilla Public License.
Lots of tidying up.
Added README, INSTALL, RELEASE_NOTES and CHANGELOG.
