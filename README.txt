README: OpenCMISS-Cmgui Application

The OpenCMISS-Cmgui Application (Cmgui) is a general purpose application for visualising and interacting with complex finite element models and image-based fields.  It is built on the OpenCMISS-Zinc Library and shares its strengths in field storage, including many finite element basis types, a mathematical field abstraction layer including image processing, and high quality 3D visualisation using OpenGL.

Cmgui has a custom command language combined with a perl interpreter for loading, saving and working with models.  Its user interface is built with wxWidgets and includes the main command window, the scene editor for creating graphics, graphics windows for 3-D rendering, and a few other dialogs.

This software was originally developed at The University of Auckland and Copyright is held by Auckland UniServices Ltd. and other contributors.  See file COPYRIGHT.txt in the same folder.
