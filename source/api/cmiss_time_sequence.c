DESCRIPTION :
Sets the <time> for the given <time_index> in the <time_sequence>.  This 
should only be done for unmanaged time sequences (as otherwise this sequence
may be shared by many other objects which are not expecting changes).
If the sequence does not have as many times as the <time_index> then it will
be expanded and the unspecified times also set to <time>.
