/*******************************************************************************
FILE : computed_field.h

LAST MODIFIED : 28 October 2004

DESCRIPTION :
A Computed_field is an abstraction of an FE_field. For each FE_field there is
a wrapper Computed_field automatically generated that can be called on to
evaluate the field in an element or node. The interface for evaluating
Computed_fields is much simpler than for FE_field, since they hide details of
caching of FE_element_field_values, for example. Their main benefit is in
allowing new types of fields to be defined as functions of other fields and
source information, such as scale, offset, magnitude, gradient,
coordinate transformations etc., thus providing cmgui with the ability to
provide customised features without cluttering dialogs such as the graphical
element editor. Also, finite_element_to_graphics_object is greatly simplified
because it can assume all coordinate and other fields are in rectangular
cartesian coordinates - if they are not already, the rest of the program can
make a simple wrapper computed_field effecting this change. A positive
consequence of this change is that this file should in time contain the only
code for invoking coordinate transformations in the entire program.

In addition to these functional benefits, computed fields cache the last
position they were evaluated at and the values and derivatives of the field at
that point so that if values at that point are requested again they can be
immediately returned. This allows functions using a number of fields, some
possibly depending on each other to get the maximum benefit out of values that
have already been calculated, without requiring complex logic for determining
if a value is already known.

FIBRE_AXES and GRADIENT are examples of such fields, since they require
top-level coordinate derivatives. The term "top_level" refers to an ultimate
parent element for the face or line, eg. the 3-D element parent to 2-D faces.
If no such top level element is supplied and one is required, then the first
available parent element will be chosen - if the user requires a top-level
element in the same group as the face or with the face on the correct side,
then they should supply the top_level_element here.

The <values> and <derivatives> arrays must be large enough to store all the
values and derivatives for this field in the given element, ie. values is

LAST MODIFIED : 15 March 1999

DESCRIPTION :
Conditional function returning true if the field is suitable for 3-D streamline
tracking. This means it has either 3, 6 or 9 components (with 3 components per
vector), or has a FIBRE coordinate_system, meaning it can be wrapped to produce
9-component fibre_axes.  Also now supports 2 components for use with a 2
component coordinate field.
The number of components controls how the field is interpreted:
3 = 1 3-D vector (lateral direction and normal worked out from curl of field);
6 = 2 3-D vectors (2nd vector is lateral direction. Stream ribbon normal found
    from cross product);
9 = 3 3-D vectors (2nd vector is lateral direction; 3rd vector is stream ribbon
    normal).

/*******************************************************************************
LAST MODIFIED : 13 March 2003

DESCRIPTION :
This function implements the reverse of some certain computed_fields
(Computed_field_is_find_element_xi_capable) so that it tries to find an element
and xi which would evaluate to the given values.
This has been implemented so that the texture_coordinates can be used to extract
information from textures (sample_texture computed_field) and then modified and
then put back into another texture.
The <search_element_group> is the set of elements from which the chosen element
will belong.
If <propagate_field> is set and the field has a find_element_xi_function, it
is called to undo its field calculation and resume the search on its source
field. This can be result in less computation, but can fail if the source field
is multivalued, a common case being when it is in a polar coordinate system
since valid values may be a multiple of  2*PI out.
An <element_dimension> of 0 searches in elements of all dimension, any other
value searches just elements of that dimension.
If <propagate_field> is not set or there is no <find_element_xi_function> this
function searches all elements in <search_element_group> trying to find a point
at which the field evaluates to the <values>.

/*******************************************************************************
LAST MODIFIED : 3 February 1999

DESCRIPTION :
Modifier entry function for creating and modifying Computed_fields. Format for
parameters from the parse state are:
  FIELD_NAME|NEW_FIELD_NAME
    components #
      rectangular_cartesian/cylindrical_polar/spherical_polar/prolate_sph...
        component
          FIELD_NAME.COMPONENT_NAME

        gradient
				  scalar FIELD_NAME
					coordinate FIELD_NAME
        rc_coordinate
					coordinate FIELD_NAME
        scale
				  field FIELD_NAME
				  values # # ... #{number_of_components}
        ... (more as more types added)
Note that the above layout is used because:
1. The number_of_components is often prerequisite information for setting up
the modifier functions for certain types of computed field, eg. "composite"
requires as many scalar fields as there are components, while scale has as many
floats.
2. The number_of_components and coordinate system are options for all types of
computed field so it makes sense that they are set before splitting up into the
options for the various types.
The <field_copy_void> parameter, if set, points to the field we are to modify
and should not itself be managed.
