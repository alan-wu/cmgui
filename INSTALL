This software is the cmgui part of CMISS.
It is released under the Mozilla Public License v1.1

Further information, help pages, a tracker and a wiki is available at 
http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/

Dependencies:
Cmgui-Motif Required:
Motif:  Except for the gtk and win32 versions which have no interactive
user interface, motif is required (and therefore X).  The lesstif implementation
of Motif is insufficient as the uil compiler is incomplete, instead use the
OpenMotif implementation.
OpenGL: The 3D graphics is built on OpenGL.

Cmgui-wx Required:
WxWidgets: wxWidgets-2.8.7 is required for the current version of cmgui-wx 
and can be compiled under different platform such as X, windows and Mac.
OpenGL: The 3D graphics is built on OpenGL.
Other libraries are also required please visit http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/ for
more information.

Optional but recommended:
Perl Interpreter: By embedding a perl interpreter, perl commands and control
constructs can be mixed with the 'gfx' cmgui commands.
Imagemagick: For loading and saving images.  Without this the image formats
are restricted to SGI rgb format.

A debug executable 'cmgui-debug' should be able to be built by running GNU make in
the cmgui directory.  make -f cmgui.make
If successful it will make an executable in bin/ARCH/.
An optimised executable is made with the target 'cmgui'.  make -f cmgui.make cmgui
A debug executable is made with the target 'cmgui'.  make cmgui-debug.
An optimised cmgui-wx executable is made with the target 'cmgui-wx'. make cmgui-wx.
A debug cmgui-wx executable is made with the target 'cmgui-wx'. make cmgui-wx-debug.

On AIX and IRIX there is a known problem with bootstrapping the creation of 
the uidh files.  To make these once you will need to specify these uidh files as 
targets when required by the compile, make -f cmgui.make TARGET=comfile/comfile_window.uidh

There is currently no install target, this will be developed as part of the 
reengineering to a library code platform.
